### Turso Cat Facts API
This is an example of a web service created that uses a [Turso](https://turso.tech) instance to store cat facts and allows users to retrieve and add their own cat facts as they wish.

In this example we also implement a subscription web service that will attempt to send out subscriber mail to all subscribers with a generated random cat fact.
